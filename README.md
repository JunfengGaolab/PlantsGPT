# PlantsGPT
The PlantsGPT repository serves as a tutorial for people to test and share interesting prompting examples for large language models (LLMs) for plant science. We also provide two samples (metadata structuring and spectral data analysis) with ChatGPT-4 and code interpreter integration for users to get started.

We currently focus on OpenAI's [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4), but we also welcome examples from other LLMs (for example open-sourced models or others with API access such as [GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/) and MetaAI's [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)).

Users can contribute to this repository by submitting interesting prompt examples to the [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions) section of this repository. A prompt can be submitted within different plant science categories such as [Plant Phenotyping](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-manipulation), [Home Robotics](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-home-robots), [Physical Reasoning](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-physical-reasoning), among many others.
Once submitted, the prompt will be reviewed by the community (upvote your favorites!) and added to the repository by a team of admins if it is deemed interesting and useful.
We encourage users to submit prompts that are interesting, fun, or useful. We also encourage users to submit prompts that are not necessarily "correct" or "optimal" but are interesting nonetheless.

We encourage prompt submissions formatted as markdown, so that they can be easily transferred to the main repository. Please specify which LLM you used, and if possible provide other visuals of the model in action such as videos and pictures.
