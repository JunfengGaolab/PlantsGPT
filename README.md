<h1 align="center">PlantsGPT ðŸ’¬ + code interpreter ðŸ’» tutorials</h1>

## ðŸ‘‹ brief

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ The PlantsGPT repository serves as a tutorial for people to test and share interesting prompting examples for large language models (LLMs) for plant science. We aim to push GPT + Code Interpreter to its limits, show you what's possible and unlock your creativity in plant science!

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ We currently focus on OpenAI's [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4), but we also welcome examples from other LLMs (for example open-sourced models like MetaAI's [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) or others with API access such as [GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/) and CodeX).

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Users can contribute to this repository by submitting interesting prompt examples to the [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions) section of this repository. A prompt can be submitted within different plant science categories such as [Plant Phenotyping](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-manipulation), [Data Analysis](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-home-robots), [Teaching and Education](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-physical-reasoning), among many others.
Once submitted, the prompt will be reviewed by the community (upvote your favorites!) and added to the repository by a team of admins if it is deemed interesting and useful.
We encourage users to submit prompts that are interesting, fun, or useful. We also encourage users to submit prompts that are not necessarily "correct" or "optimal" but are interesting nonetheless.

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ We encourage prompt submissions formatted as markdown, so that they can be easily transferred to the main repository. Please specify which LLMs you used, and if possible provide other visuals of the model in action such as videos and pictures.



## ðŸ’» Paper, videos and citations
Code Interpreter is an official ChatGPT [plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) for data analytics, image conversions, editing code, and more. Since July 6th, 2023, it has been available to all ChatGPT Plus users. It provides OpenAI models with a working Python interpreter in a sandboxed, firewalled execution environment. Importantly, it is possible to upload and download files.

## ðŸ’» ChatGPT-4 + Metadata Structuring 

We provide a sample [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) environment for users to test their ChatGPT prompts. The environment is a binary containing a sample inspection environment with assets such as wind turbines, electric towers, solar panels etc. The environment comes with a drone and interfaces with ChatGPT such that users can easily send commands in natural language.
