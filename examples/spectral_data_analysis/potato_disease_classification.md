Imagine you are helping me process the spectral data for potato classification and then select a couple of important wavelengths from hundreds of wavelengths. 
Step 1:
enable the code interpreter
upload the file (spectral_0715_cls.csv)

Great, you've uploaded a file named "spectral_0715_cls.csv". Let's start by loading the file to see its structure and contents. We can use pandas, a powerful data analysis library in Python, to do this.

The dataset contains 2153 columns, with each row representing a different leaf sample. The first column contains the name or ID of the leaf sample, the last column indicates the classification of each sample, and the remaining columns (from '350' to '2500') seem to represent spectral data across different wavelengths.

Let's check some basic statistical details such as percentile, mean, standard deviation, etc., of this dataset. This will give us a better understanding of the numerical columns.

The summary statistics provide the following insights about the dataset:

- The dataset consists of 332 samples.
- The spectral data ranges approximately from 0.01 to 0.21 across different wavelengths. This suggests that the data might have been normalized, as the range is close to [0, 1].
- The "classification" column, which is likely the target variable for a classification task, contains two unique values: 0 and 1. This suggests a binary classification problem.
- The mean of the "classification" column is approximately 0.23, indicating that about 23% of the samples belong to class 1, and the remaining 77% belong to class 0.

Is there a specific analysis or operation you would like to perform on this data?
