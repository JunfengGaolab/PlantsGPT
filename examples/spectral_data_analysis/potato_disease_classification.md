Imagine you are helping me process the spectral data for potato classification and then select a couple of important wavelengths from  hundreds of wavelengths. At any given point of time, you have the following abilities. You are also required to output code for some of the requests.

Question - Ask me a clarification question
Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it.
Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.  

The simulator contains a drone, along with several objects. Apart from the drone, none of the objects are movable. Within the code, we have the following commands available to us. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions.

get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a vector of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

fly_to(position): Takes a vector of 3 floats as input indicating X,Y,Z coordinates and commands the drone to fly there.

fly_path(positions): Takes a list of X,Y,Z positions indicating waypoints along a path and flies the drone along that path.

set_yaw(angle): Set the yaw angle for the drone (in degrees)

Are you ready?
